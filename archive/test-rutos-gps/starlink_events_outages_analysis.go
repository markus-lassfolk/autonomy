Your question highlights an important architectural issue:

❌ CURRENT STATE:
• Outages used for scoring but NOT prediction (missed opportunity)
• Events not used at all (wasted data)
• Risk of double-penalty if both systems react to same data

✅ RECOMMENDED STATE:
• Outages: Binary penalty (scoring) + Trend analysis (prediction)
• Events: Count penalty (scoring) + Critical event triggers (prediction)  
• Clear separation of concerns and time windows

This approach maximizes the value of Starlink's rich telemetry data while
avoiding conflicts between reactive scoring and proactive prediction.
