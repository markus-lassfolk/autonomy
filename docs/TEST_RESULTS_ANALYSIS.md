**Date**: August 17, 2025 23:02 UTC+2  
**Test Run**: #1 (Initial Deployment)

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Overall Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**
- **Test Pass Rate**: 39% (7/18 tests passed)
- **Critical Blockers**: 4 issues preventing core functionality
- **Deployment Success**: ‚úÖ Build and deployment working perfectly
- **Core Functionality**: ‚ùå Multiple blocking issues

## üîç DETAILED ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

1. **Build System & Deployment** (100% success)
   - Cross-compilation for ARMv7 working perfectly
   - Binary size acceptable (16.97MB)
   - SCP deployment successful
   - File permissions and execution working

2. **Network Discovery** (Strong performance)
   - All network interfaces detected correctly
   - mwan3 configuration parsing successful
   - Multiple interface types identified (Starlink, Cellular, WiFi)
   - Routing table analysis working

3. **Basic Daemon Operation** (Partially working)
   - Daemon starts without crashing
   - Graceful shutdown working
   - Structured logging operational
   - Signal handling functional

### ‚ùå CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES

#### 1. UCI Configuration Parsing Failure (CRIT-001)
**Impact**: BLOCKING - Prevents proper daemon configuration
```
[FAIL] UCI Configuration Parsing - FAILED - Configuration has parsing errors
```
**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- Configuration file format validation
- UCI parser implementation review
- Compatibility with OpenWrt 21.02.0

#### 2. ubus Service Registration Failure (CRIT-002)
**Impact**: BLOCKING - No API access, CLI tools non-functional
```
[FAIL] ubus Service Registration - FAILED - autonomy service not registered
```
**Evidence**:
- ubus list shows no autonomy service
- CLI commands fail completely
- API layer completely inaccessible

**Log Evidence**:
```json
{"level":"info","msg":"ubus socket registration disabled - using CLI-based approach for RUTOS compatibility","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:20Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"ubus CLI available - RPC functionality ready","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:20Z"}
{"level":"info","msg":"ubus server started successfully (CLI mode)","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:20Z"}
```
**Analysis**: Daemon claims ubus is working but service not actually registered

#### 3. Decision Engine "No Eligible Members" (CRIT-003)
**Impact**: BLOCKING - Core failover logic non-functional
```json
{"error":"no eligible members","level":"error","msg":"Failed to make decision","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:25Z"}
{"level":"error","msg":"Error in decision engine tick","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:25Z"}
```
**Frequency**: Every 5 seconds (continuous failure)
**Root Cause**: Member eligibility logic failing despite discovering 2 viable members

#### 4. Starlink API Inaccessible (CRIT-004)
**Impact**: HIGH - Primary interface data source unavailable
```
[FAIL] Starlink gRPC Port - FAILED - Port 9200 not accessible
[FAIL] Starlink HTTP Port - FAILED - Port 80 not accessible
```
**Network Evidence**:
- Starlink dish IP (192.168.100.1) is reachable via ping
- Both gRPC (9200) and HTTP (80) ports closed
- May indicate Starlink dish configuration issue

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 5. Cellular Data Source Missing (HIGH-001)
```
[FAIL] Cellular ubus (mobiled) - FAILED - mobiled service not available
```
**Impact**: No cellular metrics collection
**Interfaces Available**: wwan0, qmimux0 (hardware present)
**Issue**: Software integration missing

#### 6. GPS Data Collection Failing (HIGH-002)
```
[PASS] RUTOS GPS (gsmctl) - PASSED - GPS data available
GPS Data: ERROR
[FAIL] RUTOS GPS (ubus) - FAILED - No GPS data from ubus
```
**Analysis**: GPS hardware may be present but returning error data

## üìã MEMBER DISCOVERY ANALYSIS

**Discovered Members**: 3 total
- `wan_m1` (Starlink) - ‚úÖ Viable
- `mob1s1a1_m1` (Cellular) - ‚úÖ Viable  
- `member1` (mob1s2a1) - ‚ùå Interface down

**Data Limits Discovery**: Working
```json
{"days_until_reset":14,"interface":"mob1s1a1","level":"info","limit_mb":1000,"msg":"Discovered data limits","status":"ok","ts":"2025-08-17T21:02:19Z","usage_mb":1.033651351928711,"usage_percent":0.1033651351928711}
```

**Issue**: Despite 2 viable members, decision engine reports "no eligible members"

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Issue Resolution (Priority 1)

#### Action 1: Fix UCI Configuration Parsing
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Steps**:
1. Extract and analyze the exact UCI parsing error
2. Test with minimal configuration
3. Validate against OpenWrt 21.02.0 UCI format
4. Fix parser implementation

#### Action 2: Debug ubus Service Registration  
**Timeline**: Immediate

## üîç LOG ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

**Error Pattern Analysis**:
- **Error Rate**: 8.9% (4 errors in 45 log lines)
- **Error Frequency**: Every 5 seconds (decision engine tick)
- **Error Type**: Consistent "no eligible members" failure
- **Recovery**: No automatic recovery observed

**Positive Indicators**:
- Structured JSON logging working correctly
- Graceful shutdown functioning
- No memory corruption or crashes
- Clean startup sequence

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Focus on UCI parsing** - This is likely blocking other functionality
2. **Debug ubus registration** - Essential for API access
3. **Add extensive debug logging** - Need visibility into decision engine

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Implement robust fallback mechanisms** - For missing data sources
2. **Add health checks** - For all critical components
3. **Improve error handling** - Graceful degradation

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Performance optimization** - After functionality is stable
2. **Advanced feature testing** - GPS, notifications, WiFi optimization
3. **Load testing** - Extended operation validation
