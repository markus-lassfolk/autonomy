# autonomy - Intelligent Multi-Interface Failover System

A production-ready, autonomous, and resource-efficient multi-interface failover daemon for RutOS and OpenWrt routers with advanced predictive capabilities and comprehensive monitoring.

## Overview

autonomy is a Go-based daemon that provides intelligent multi-interface failover management for Starlink, cellular (multi-SIM), Wi-Fi STA/tethering, and LAN uplinks. It uses predictive behavior and machine learning to ensure users never experience network degradation or outages.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Auto-Discovery** of mwan3 members and underlying netifd interfaces
- **Multi-Class Support**: Starlink, Cellular (multi-SIM), Wi-Fi, LAN with specialized metrics
- **Predictive Failover** based on health scoring, trend analysis, and pattern recognition
- **Native Integration** with UCI, ubus, procd, and mwan3
- **Resource-Efficient**: minimal CPU wakeups, RAM caps, low traffic on metered links

### Advanced Monitoring & Analytics
- **Starlink API Integration**: Native gRPC client for real-time Starlink metrics
- **Cellular Intelligence**: RSRP, RSRQ, SINR monitoring with production-grade OpenCellID geolocation
- **Wi-Fi Optimization**: Channel analysis, RSSI-weighted scoring, 5-star rating system
- **GPS Integration**: Multi-source GPS data collection and movement detection
- **Obstruction Monitoring**: Predictive obstruction detection and management

### System Reliability
- **Watchdog & Failsafe System**: Independent process for daemon health monitoring
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from failures and performance degradation
- **Performance Profiling**: CPU/memory usage calculation and GC tuning
- **Security Auditing**: Threat detection (brute force, port scanning, DoS/DDoS)

### Observability & Notifications
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with comprehensive observability
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Pushover, Email, Slack, Discord, Telegram, Webhook, SMS
- **Telemetry Store**: RAM-based ring buffers for short-term metric storage
- **MQTT Integration**: Real-time telemetry publishing
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Health scores, performance data, and system analytics
